# Taj's Mod

> **WIP** – A growing collection of **Utility / QoL + Visual Tweaks** for [Upload Labs](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2881650/Upload_Labs/), without overhauling the core gameplay loop.

## About

The plan is simple: keep expanding this into a "make the game better" toolbox — more settings, more convenience features, more polish, hopefully without turning it into bloat.

This started as **TajsView** — one specific "my take"/vibe for Upload Labs. But the more I worked on it, the more it became obvious I don't really want one direction. I just want to tweak everything that can be improved. So from the working title **TajsView**, it turned into simply **Taj's Mod**.

> _Also: I wanted to keep the naming vibe from my [TajsGraph](https://ficsit.app/mod/TajsGraph) mod for Satisfactory lol._

If something feels missing, annoying, or you want a specific option/toggle — let me know! I actively read feedback for the game itself, and I'll do the same for the mod. Your suggestion might end up in the next update.

## Features

A clean bundle of QoL, visuals, and power-user tools — with any gameplay-affecting stuff kept strictly **opt-in**.

### 🎛️ General / QoL

- **Command Palette (MMB/Space)** — Fuzzy search for commands, settings, and navigation.
- **Mod Settings Panel** — A deeper settings menu accessible via the puzzle piece icon.
- **Toast History** — Missed a notification? Check the log via the bell icon.
- **Mute on Focus Loss** — Auto-mute game audio when you tab out (configurable volume).
- **Real-time Node Counter** — Track your node usage vs the limit.
- **Smart Screenshots** — HQ capture overrides, and resolution settings.

### 🎨 Visuals

- **Group Node Patterns** — Custom patterns (Dots, Stripes, Zipzag, etc.) with adjustable opacity and colors.
- **Wire Colors** — Customize wire colors by resource type (Power, Data, etc.).
- **Disconnected Node Highlighter** — Visual aids (`Pulse` or `Outline` style) to find unconnected nodes.
- **Extra Glow & Bloom** — Tweak intensity, bloom, and sensitivity of game visuals.
- **UI Opacity** — Adjust HUD transparency.
- **Custom Boot Screen** — A cleaner startup screen (optional).

### 🔧 Tools & Utilities

- **Wire Drop Menu** — Drop a wire on empty space to instantly open a compatible node spawner.
- **Quick Navigation** — "Jump to Group" and "Jump to Note" commands to zoom to specific areas.
- **Screenshot Selection** — Capture only the currently selected nodes (transparent background supported).
- **Sticky Notes** — Place colored text notes on the canvas.
- **Universal Clear Wires** — Right-click output slots or use "Clear Wires" on a selection to clean up.
- **The Bin** — A dedicated trash node for easy deletion.
- **6-Input Containers** — Option to increase container inputs from 5 to 6.

### 🎮 Gameplay (Opt-in)

- **Buy Max Button** — Smart button to buy max affordable upgrades (Lowest/Highest cost strategy).
- **Node Limit Control** — Increase limit up to 2000 or set to Unlimited (∞).
- **Disable Controller Input** — Completely block gamepad input to prevent interference.
- **Cheats Panel** — Modify Money, Research, and Tokens (Add/Remove %, Set to 0).

> **Important:** Anything that affects gameplay is **opt-in** and clearly separated from pure QoL/visual settings.

### 🐛 Debug/Troubleshooting

- **Debug Logging** — Toggle verbose logs for troubleshooting.
- **Reset All Settings** — One click back to defaults.
- **Debug Info** — logs current currency values and limits.
