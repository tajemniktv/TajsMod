# Taj's Mod

> **Very WIP** – A growing collection of **Utility / QoL + Visual Tweaks** for [Upload Labs](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2881650/Upload_Labs/), without overhauling the core gameplay loop.

## About

The plan is simple: keep expanding this into a "make the game better" toolbox — more settings, more convenience features, more polish, hopefully without turning it into bloat.

This started as **TajsView** — one specific "my take"/vibe for Upload Labs. But the more I worked on it, the more it became obvious I don't really want one direction. I just want to tweak everything that can be improved. So from the working title **TajsView**, it turned into simply **Taj's Mod**.

> *Also: I wanted to keep the naming vibe from my [TajsGraph](https://ficsit.app/mod/TajsGraph) mod for Satisfactory lol.*

If something feels missing, annoying, or you want a specific option/toggle — let me know! I actively read feedback for the game itself, and I'll do the same for the mod. Your suggestion might end up in the next update.
