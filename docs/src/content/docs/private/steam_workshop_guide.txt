Quick Start Guide

[h2]1. Accessing the Mod[/h2]
Once installed, look for the new [b]Puzzle Piece icon[/b] in the top HUD (Extras Buttons area). This is your main hub for configuring the mod.

[h2]2. Using the Command Palette[/h2]
Press the [b]Middle Mouse Button[/b] anywhere on the desktop to open the palette.
[list]
[*] Type to fuzzy-search for nodes, commands, or settings.
[*] Use it to quickly toggle options or find specific nodes without navigating menus.
[*] Tip: Add your most-used commands to Favorites (Ctrl+F) for instant access.
[/list]

[h2]3. Wire Drop System[/h2]
Speed up your building by dragging a wire from any output and releasing it on an [b]empty grid space[/b].
A popup menu will appear, allowing you to instantly spawn a compatible node that automatically connects to your wire.

[h2]4. Managing Large Factories[/h2]
[list]
[*] [b]Jump to Group:[/b] Use the new button in the bottom-left corner to see a list of all your Node Groups. Select one to instantly pan the camera to it.
[*] [b]Bulk Upgrades:[/b] Use the "Buy Max" button in the upgrade tab (or on selected nodes) to spend your points efficiently.
[/list]





Settings & Configuration

All configuration is handled in-game. No config files to edit manually!

[h2]Settings[/h2]
[list]
[*] [b]General:[/b] Node limits, specific tool toggles.
[*] [b]Visuals:[/b] Wire colors, UI opacity, glow settings.
[*] [b]Cheats:[/b] Currency buttons (hidden by default unless you go looking).
[*] [b]Debug:[/b] Logs and boot screen toggles.
[/list]

[h2]Recommended Defaults[/h2]
[list]
[*] [b]Node Limit:[/b] Set to ~500 or "Unlimited" if you have a strong PC. The vanilla limit is strict for performance, but modern CPUs can handle much more.
[*] [b]Focus Mute:[/b] [b]ON[/b]. It’s a lifesaver if you play while watching videos or working.
[/list]





Compatibility


This mod uses [b]ModLoader[/b] and should be compatible with most other mods.
[quote]
[b]Technical Note:[/b] This mod patches [code]desktop.gd[/code] and some HUD elements. If you have other mods that drastically alter the main desktop input or the HUD overlay, load order may matter.

Troubleshooting

If you subscribed but the mod isn’t working, here’s what to try (top to bottom):

[h2]1) Verify Steam actually downloaded the Workshop files[/h2]

[list]
[*] Open your Steam Library
[*] Right-click [b]Upload Labs[/b] → [b]Manage[/b] → [b]Browse Local Files[/b]
[*]You’ll likely see a path similar to:
[code]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Upload Labs[/code]

[*]Now go to the Workshop content folder instead:
[code]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content[/code]

[*]Find and open the folder:
[code]3606890[/code]

[*]Inside it, find and open:
[code]3628222709[/code]

[*]You should see:
[code]TajemnikTV-TajsModded.zip[/code]
[/list]

[b]What you’re looking for:[/b]
[list]
[*] If the .zip exists and its size is [b]not 0 bytes[/b] → Steam downloaded it correctly.
[*] If the file is missing or is [b]0 bytes[/b] → it’s likely a Steam download/workshop issue. Try the Steam-related fixes below.
[/list]

[h2]2) Steam-related fixes (when it doesn’t download / stays broken)[/h2]

Community tips for cases that look like Steam being the culprit:

[list]
[*] [b]Restart Steam[/b] (fully close it, then open again)
[*] [b]Unsubscribe and resubscribe[/b] to the mod
[*] [b]Verify game files[/b]:
[list]
[*] Steam Library → right-click [b]Upload Labs[/b] → [b]Properties[/b] → [b]Installed Files[/b] → [b]Verify integrity of game files[/b]
[/list]
[/list]

If none of that helps and the Workshop file still won’t download, it’s very likely something on Steam’s side (Workshop syncing / downloads). In that case, use the GitHub download as a workaround:

[h2]3) Clear Mod Loader cached data[/h2]

[list]
[*] Press [b]Windows + R[/b]
[*] Type:
[code]%appdata%[/code]
[*] Press [b]Enter[/b]
[*] Open the folder:
[code]Upload Labs[/code]
[*] Delete these files (if they exist):
[list]
[*][code]mod_loader_cache.json[/code]
[*][code]mod_user_profiles.json[/code]
[/list]
[/list]

[h2]4) Reinstall Upload Labs[/h2]

[list]
[*] Uninstall Upload Labs in Steam
[*] Install it again
[*]Launch the game and re-check the mod
[/list]

[b]UI missing or strange bugs?[/b]
[list]
[*] Go to mod settings (General Tab) and try clicking "Reset Config".
[*] Check if you accidentally set "UI Opacity" to 0 in the Visuals tab.
[/list]

[b]Performance issues?[/b]
[list]
[*] If you set the Node Limit to "Unlimited" and built a mega-base, the game might slow down. This is an engine limitation, not a mod bug.
[/list]

[h2]Still not working?[/h2]

Create an issue at [url=https://github.com/tajemniktv/TajsGraph/issues]GitHub[/url] or report it in the [url=https://discord.gg/enigmadev]EnigmaDev Discord[/url] and ping [b]@TajemnikTV[/b].





FAQ

[b]Q: Can I add or remove this mod mid-save?[/b]
A: Yes. It is generally safe to add or remove. Note that if you built more nodes than the vanilla limit allows, removing the mod might stop you from placing [i]new[/i] nodes until you are back under the limit, but your existing factory should remain.

[b]Q: Does this disable achievements?[/b]
A: No, standard modding rules apply (usually achievements still work unless specifically disabled by the game developer).

[b]Q: Where are my screenshots saved?[/b]
A: They are saved in your user directory. Check the "General" tab in settings for a button to open the folder directly.
