title: User-Friendly Mod Names API
description: Taj's Mod Settings Manager supports displaying user-friendly names for mods in the "Mod Manager" list, instead of just the internal Mod ID or Manifest Name.
---

## How to Implement

To give your mod a custom display name, simply define a public `get_mod_name()` function in your mod's main script (the script that extends `Node` and is loaded by ModLoader).

### Example (`mod_main.gd`)

```gdscript
extends Node

# ... your existing code ...

## API: Returns the user-friendly name of this mod
func get_mod_name() -> String:
    return "My Awesome Mod"
```

## How it Works

When the "Mod Manager" tab is built:
1. It iterates through all active mods.
2. It attempts to find the main instance of your mod in the `ModLoader` system.
3. It checks if your main instance has a method called `get_mod_name`.
4. If found, it calls this method and uses the returned String as the display name.
5. If not found, it falls back to the name defined in your `manifest.json`.

## Best Practices

- Keep the name concise.
- You can include versioning if you want, but the list already displays the version number from the manifest automatically.
- This is purely visual and does not affect Mod IDs or dependencies.
